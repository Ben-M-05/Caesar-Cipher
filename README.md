# Caesar-Cipher

##### I haven't really used C# in a while but it was about time I fully got into **.NET** development.

### Features:
 * *The Caesar Cipher script of course*
 * *Brute Force and Frequency Analysis scripts*
 * *Key encryption using RSA Async keys*



**Note: I have the Advanced Encrytion where it generates RSA keys every method call. I'll probably make a key generation script soon**
